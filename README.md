# My-Portfolio-React

This project is a work in progress but my final goal is to have a working portfolio made through react and to learn more about react on the way. If you would like to look at it, the project is deployed through netlify at [https://shreya-thoth.netlify.app/](https://shreya-thoth.netlify.app/).

## My Journey
* Day 1: I've just learned how to make tabs on React following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzKdpPa3J4) and in the process I also learned how to...
  - Set up a React project using Vite and add [the tailwind CSS library](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)
  - create a grid background
  - add spanners, grids, buttons, and forms (with input)
* Day 2: I've added navigation bar and the website now has three pages. I removed the tabs from earlier but I plan to use them later in one of the pages. I also have experimented with integrating css files for the pages and the navigation bar.

* Day 3: The contact page is functionally done and it links to my github, linkedin, and my email (it autofills with a subject and content). I've been working on the projects page and I added some fun features like having the text on the page turn red as the mouse stays on it and the title shake and grow. I also figured out how to deploy the website following [this tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMGOfJxnH7s&t=3s).
  
 ## Next Steps
 * Add actual content into the tabs
     - Home Tab - unsure, may replace this with the about me tab for now
     - My Projects Tab - the projects I've done (school work and otherwise) and add demos if possible
     - About Me Tab - Work experience, coursework, publications, etc.
     - Contact Tab - I've linked my github, linkedin, and email but I would like to make it look nicer and add more to the page otherwise (maybe a dynamic background).
       
   - Integrate Unity games into React app using WebGl
   - Change the tab name between different pages
   - Fun features (that I've seen in other places)
       * change the tab name when user goes to another tab
    
 * Websites I want to use as inspiration (this part is mostly for me):
     - [https://zacharyespiritu.com/](https://zacharyespiritu.com/) - I want my About Me section to also be in a block structure with the lines and I think that this website looks really professional/cool, especially with all of the colors in the blocks.
     - [https://zfo.gg/](https://zfo.gg/) - I like how minimalistic it is and when I integrate my games, I want it to be as seemless as the gravity simulator.
     - [https://p5aholic.me/](https://p5aholic.me/) - The dynamic background is super cool. I think adding my own dynamic background would be fun to do after I add content to the website.
     - [https://bruno-simon.com/](https://bruno-simon.com/) - It would be cool to add some kind of 3D part but I also want to try and add sound/music to my website.
 * Bugs
   - Can scroll up and have content disappear behind nav bar - doesn't impact anything functionally but it is kind of annoying. Need a better way to add space for each of the pages behind the nav bar.
