# My-Portfolio-React

This is a long-term personal project focused on building a polished, interactive portfolio using React. My goal is to continually develop and improve the site while deepening my understanding of front-end development and web design over time So far, I have
- Set up the core structure: Home, Projects, About Me, and Contact pages
- Added and styled all page content
- Implemented interactive UI elements (e.g. hover effects with color changes and animations)

Next, I hope to add in more advanced or dynamic features and continue refining the design. The project is deployed through netlify at [https://shreya-thoth.netlify.app/](https://shreya-thoth.netlify.app/).

## My Progress
* Day 1: I've just learned how to make tabs on React following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzKdpPa3J4) and in the process I also learned how to...
  - Set up a React project using Vite and add [the tailwind CSS library](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)
  - create a grid background
  - add spanners, grids, buttons, and forms (with input)
* Day 2: I've added navigation bar and the website now has three pages. I removed the tabs from earlier but I plan to use them later in one of the pages. I also have experimented with integrating css files for the pages and the navigation bar.

* Day 3: The contact page is functionally done and it links to my github, linkedin, and my email (it autofills with a subject and content). I've been working on the projects page and I added some fun features like having the text on the page turn red as the mouse stays on it and the title shake and grow. I also figured out how to deploy the website following [this tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMGOfJxnH7s&t=3s)
* Day 4: I filled in all of the content I wanted for the home page, the about me page, and the projects page and I changed the color scheme using a [color scheme generator](https://coolors.co/). I also reformatted all of the pages to look a little nicer.
* Day 5: I finally made a mockup of what I want my website to look like. I'm keeping it basic for now but I hope to have the home page done soon.

 ## Next Steps
 * For each tab
     - Home Tab - I need to add some kind of dynamic background but I would like to make it myself. I'm thinking of something like [this](https://p5aholic.me/) or [this](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)
     - My Projects Tab - I need to add more projects and demos when possible (unity, react, etc.)
     - About Me Tab - It's kinda boring, maybe I'll add a trivia game or make things fall off screen when clicked
     - Contact Tab - I would like to get rid of the background of the images, maybe link my spotify.
  * In general  
   - Change the tab name between different pages
   - Make colors look a little better, add more images to site
   - Fun features (that I've seen in other places)
       * change the tab name when user goes to another tab
       * Integrate Unity games into React app using WebGl
    
 * Websites I want to use as inspiration:
     - [https://zacharyespiritu.com/](https://zacharyespiritu.com/) - I want my About Me section to also be in a block structure with the lines and I think that this website looks really professional/cool, especially with all of the colors in the blocks.
     - [https://zfo.gg/](https://zfo.gg/) - I like how minimalistic it is and when I integrate my games, I want it to be as seemless as the gravity simulator.
     - [https://p5aholic.me/](https://p5aholic.me/) - The dynamic background is super cool. I think adding my own dynamic background would be fun to do after I add content to the website.
     - [https://bruno-simon.com/](https://bruno-simon.com/) - It would be cool to add some kind of 3D part but I also want to try and add sound/music to my website.
 * Bugs
   - Can scroll up and have content disappear behind nav bar - doesn't impact anything functionally but it is kind of annoying. Need a better way to add space for each of the pages behind the nav bar.
   - Not really mobile compatible, considering using Tailwind CSS but transfer seems kind of annoying - will look into other options
