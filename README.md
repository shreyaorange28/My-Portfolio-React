# My-Portfolio-React

This project is a work in progress but my final goal is to have a working portfolio made through react. I'm also learning react in the process so I'll be documenting what I've learned below.

## My Journey
* Day 1: I've just learned how to make tabs on React following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzKdpPa3J4) and in the process I also learned how to...
  - Set up a React project using Vite and add [the tailwind CSS library](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)
  - create a grid background
  - add spanners, grids, buttons, and forms (with input)

 ## Next Steps
 * Improvements
   - Add actual content to the tabs
   - Make the tabs fill the screen/implement them differently
   - Add more features to each tab (layers, links, embeds of things)
   - Integrate Unity into React app using WebGl (i think this is possible)
   - Make the form work and make the buttons do things
 * Bugs
   - The background doesn't span the entire screen (only a little past where the element inside of it is)
